Todo:
 - Allow computation and storage of symmetries
 - Allow calls and methods to be properly mixed during spliced
 - Allow methods to have custom rule-offs
 - Fix when lead end calls turn up in lead end strings
 - Beef up unit tests

Intentionally Not Done:
 - Multithreading on extent generation
 
Done:
 - Search method database by place notation
 - Store awkward calls (e.g. for Stedman, Erin) in database
 - QP true is not strict enough
 - Fix touches being prematurely stopped for Stedman
 - Improve efficiency on called change touches
